Ravenstone is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers, identical to the computers found in Redpower 2.    
The computers in Ravenstone are powered by a 16-bit stack-based architecture focused on simplicity.

## Blocks and Items found in this mod
- Raven-8t Computer: The powerful 16-bit computer that is the heart of all computer setups in the Ravenstone mod.
- Terminal: Allows the Raven-8t Computer to output information and to let the user input information to the computer.
- Floppy Disk Drive: Allows the computer to store/retrieve data from Floppy Disks.
- Memory Upgrades: At default, the Raven-8t Computer only comes with a mere 8 KiB of RAM, you can add more RAM by attaching a 16 KiB, 32 KiB, or a 64 KiB upgrade to the back of the computer.
- Ribbon Cables: Lets you attach peripherals that are not directly connected to the Raven-8t Computer.
- Floppy Disk: A removable storage medium that can hold up to 256 KiB of data.
- System Floppy Disks: Includes the FORTH disk and the Magpie disk. The Magpie disk is a Work in Progress and is only available in Creative Mode at the moment.
